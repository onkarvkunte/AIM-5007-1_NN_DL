## Introduction

The rapid development of autonomous vehicles has amplified the need for accurate traffic sign recognition systems. This project explores modern deep learning techniques to address the challenges posed by varying traffic signs, lighting conditions, and geographical differences.

Our research benchmarks a custom CNN model against widely used pretrained architectures such as ResNet, EfficientNet, and DenseNet.

## Features

- Developed a custom CNN model tailored for traffic sign recognition.
- Evaluated and fine-tuned pretrained models, including ResNet50, DenseNet121, and EfficientNetB0.
- Utilized the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) dataset.
- Achieved over 99% accuracy with the custom CNN model.
- Compared performance metrics, including training and validation loss, across models.
